    \section*{Testing Setup}

    \begin{itemize}

        \item[] In order for the testing project to be run as a JUnit test,
        three dependencies are required, as described in the \texttt{.classpath} file.

        \item[] Namely, 
        \begin{itemize} 
            \item[] \texttt{SelfCheckoutSystem - Hardware - v3.1},
            \item[] \texttt{SelfCheckoutSystem - Software},
            \item[] and JUnit 4 
        \end{itemize}
        are required dependencies.

    \end{itemize}

    \section*{Project Description}

    Our simulator has three main sections; an attendant console, station(s), and hardware simulator.
    
    Once a user starts a transaction on a station, they can perform a variety of actions,
    such as adding their own bags, looking up products, entering a PLU, buying bags, and paging the attendent for help.
    Most of this functionality is implemented via buttons that toggle between different panels with inputs.

    The hardware simulator has functionality to simulate scanning items,
    adding items to the bagging area, adding coins and banknotes, and inserting a card.

    The attendent console can start and shutdown stations, as well as block them.
